# Homework

Each team, composed of 4 students, must co-operate to train and validate a `keras model` using the provided dataset.

We will test your trained model on our private test set.
In order to fulfill your homework:

4.  In this directory, save:
1.  a copy of your trained `keras model` in a subdirectory named `model`;


      * check that it can be loaded using the `load_model` keras function;
    2. a copy of your training notebook named `train.ipynb` containing the full training procedure implementation;
      * comment it to motivate your design choices;
    3. a copy of your test notebook named `test.ipynb` on your validation set;
      * run it and check that everything works as you expected;

5.  ONE STUDENT FOR EACH TEAM submit your Google Drive directory link. Provide us the team number, too.
